# Predicting_Heart_Disease

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 17.9 million individuals die each year due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).<br> There are several risk factors that could contribute to an individual's likelihood of developing CVD, such as an unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, or mental illnesses. Identifying these risk factors in individuals early on could potentially prevent numerous premature deaths.

The goal of this project is to create a **K-Nearest Neighbors classifier** that can accurately **predict** the likelihood of a patient **developing heart disease in the future.**

As I progress in learning, I will return to this project with all that newfound knowledge! <br>
